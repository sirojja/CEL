 # CEL - Console English Learner
 CEL is a console application for repeating English words. The dict/ directory stores dictionaries in .txt format containing words in Russian and English. 

The program randomly takes words from the dictionary and offers to remember them.

You can add new words to the dictionary, the program uses the google translator API. You need to install:

```python
pip3 install deep-translator
```



For convenience, create a link to CEL:


```bash
cd CEL
sudo ln CEL /usr/bin/CEL
```
I wrote it to make it easier for me to repeat English words in the terminal, you can also use it for this purpose!
